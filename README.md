# hello-world
My first repo, I should have began earlier, but then better late than never.
Been through all the paradigms:
  Assembly language for Intel 8086
  C for structural programming
  C++ for OOP
  MATLAB and most recently Python, HTML, JS, CSS and using the vast libraries and tools to develop web apps.
